```javascript
test('should render component', () => {
  console.log('    ✅ Test 1/5: Component rendering validation');
  
  render(<Component />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  console.log('       📥 Input: Component render request');
  console.log('       📤 Response: Component rendered with "Hello" text visible');
});
```
